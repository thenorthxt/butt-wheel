ButtWheel is a rotating flywheel designed to sustain momentum across the Buttcoin meme ecosystem.

It is not built to trap value in a single asset,  
but to **circulate momentum** while reinforcing its own core.

---

## Core Thesis

Most meme coins attempt to absorb all attention and liquidity.

ButtWheel takes a different approach:
- reinforce itself internally
- while remaining outward-facing to the broader Buttcoin meta

The result is a system that compounds without isolating itself.

---

## The ButtWheel Mechanism

ButtWheel operates as a simple, transparent flywheel.

### High-level flow

1. **Activity generates fees**
2. **50% of fees are used to buy back ButtWheel**
3. **The remaining portion is deployed into the Buttcoin meme layer**
4. **Internal buybacks reinforce the wheel**
5. **External deployment aligns ButtWheel with the broader meta**
6. **Meta growth feeds attention back into the wheel**
7. **Activity continues**

The loop stays open.  
Momentum keeps moving.

## Why ButtWheel Works

ButtWheel balances two forces:

- **Self-reinforcement**  
  Buybacks strengthen the wheel internally and support long-term holders.

- **Meta-alignment**  
  External deployment ensures relevance inside the Buttcoin ecosystem instead of competing against it.

This prevents stagnation and keeps ButtWheel structurally connected.

## Design Principles

- No dead-end liquidity  
- No isolated asset thinking  
- No dependency on constant launches  

ButtWheel exists to **rotate**, not to hoard.

---

## Value Flow Philosophy

Value is not meant to stop.

When value is allowed to circulate:
- relevance increases
- attention persists
- participation remains organic

ButtWheel treats circulation as a feature, not a leak.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` — mechanism explanations, routing logic, parameters
- `scripts/` — simulations and flow modeling
- `programs/` — future on-chain automation
- `apps/` — dashboards and transparency tools
- `packages/` — shared primitives

---

## Status

ButtWheel is in the design and modeling phase.

This repository documents:
- fee routing logic
- internal vs external reinforcement
- assumptions and constraints

All mechanics are subject to iteration.

---

## Closing

ButtWheel doesn’t try to dominate the meta.

It stays in motion inside it.

Momentum isn’t captured.  
It’s rotated.
